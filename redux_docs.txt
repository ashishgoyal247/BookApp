                                     REDUX
                                    
Redux:
A function that returns a piece of application state. Our applications can have many piece
of states so we can have many reducers. Value of state is produced by reducers.       

Container:
  A React Component that has a direct connection to the state managed by redux.

Container vs Component:
  Most parent Component that uses/cares about a piece of state is made the container.     

mapStateToProps(state):
  Takes one argument, application state, returns something(mostly object) which acts as props
  for the container in which it is defined.  

connect:
  Takes the component and mapStateToProps and returns the container which is exported from
  that file.

Whenever application state changes all containers rerender.

combineReducers:
  Adds key to global spplication state.


1. On any event action creator is called. Action creator is a function that returns an object.
2. That object is then sent to all the reducers.
3. Reducers then can choose depending on the action to return a different piece of state.
4. The newly returned piece of state gets piped into application state.
5. The application state then gets pumped back to React application that causes all components
   to rerender.

The object(called action) returned from Action creator has a
1. type that describes the type of action that wasjust triggered.
2. Data or payload which further describes the action.

Reducer generally contains switch statement which selects the piece of statement to be returned
depending on the action type.

Once all reducers return the new piece of state, all states get assembled in the combineReducers
and pump back into all diff containers. All containers will run mapStateToProps and render 
different data.
